Nets represent connections between hardware elements.
Nets are declared with the keyword wire.
Nets have values continuously driven on them by the outputs of devices
that they are connected to.
Default value of a net = z

wire a ;
wire b, c;

wire d = 1'b0; // Net d is fixed to logic value 0

net is not a keyword but a class of data types
 - wire
 - wand
 - wor
 - tri
 - triand
 - trior
 - trireg

Registers represent data storage elements. They are variable.
Unlike a net, a register does not need a driver.
Registers are declared by reg.
Default value of reg = x

reg reset;
